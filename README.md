# Database project 1 : CRUD

In this project I have tried all the basic commands of the SQL and implement them via creating a new database and other tables

In this project i have 2 created 2 tables under the database named as "BankDB"
- Customers and 
- contacts

I have used SQL queries in order to enter and fetch the data present in the database

- select command
- alter command
- update command
- set command
- insert into command
- where clause etc

### This is just a small demo project
